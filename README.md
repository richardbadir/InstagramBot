#InstagramBot and DMS
A simple Instagram bot and DM Notifier

# InstagramBot
Very Simple Follow/Unfollow Instagram Bot

# Warning: Use at your own risk. If you do, you will get banned.

This simple IG bot follows accounts based on some keywords that it looks for in name username and bio of the accounts. 

It keeps track of the accounts it follows, and then the unfollow.py script can be used later to unfollow the accounts that were followed using follow.py

I initially made this bot to help my friend's brand grow (shoutout cassowear).

#DMS Notifications

Very simple script to send an email if you have instagram DMs. Need to allow access to less secure apps in your gmail account.

Could be upgraded in many ways, most importantly on a security front (The InstagramBot as well). Passwords and username are in plain text in the source code.

Could use OAuth to not require gmail account to allow access to less secure apps. 

Could keep track of last number of dms received and only send an email when there is really a New dm.

Could use AWS to have this script run once an hour or so.

Could turn this into a website to sign up for notifications using node.js

(I probably will not be implementing these features, because I decided tow work on a differetn project since I will probably not use this DM notifier)
